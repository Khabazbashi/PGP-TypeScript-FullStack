# Puppies App with TypeScript, Express, React

This app is a continuation of the puppies API project (https://github.com/Khabazbashi/PGP-TypeScript-API ) where a restful API was created that supported CRUD operations and was strongly typed with TypeScript. The goal was to create a frontend to the API that allows the user to look at a list of puppies, add and remove them. This application was created to continue to further my learning in TypesScript.
